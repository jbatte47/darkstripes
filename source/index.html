<a name="why" class="anchor" href="#why"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h1>

<p>Ah. Good question. I have what's called ADD, you see. It prevents me from being able to concentrate very hey that reminds me. Did you ever hear about how some monks can concentrate so hard, that they can slow their heart rate to almost nothing? My heart nearly stopped when I went skydiving, but that was from too much fun. Which I definitely had a lot of this weekend. Fun, I mean. Now I don't wanna go back to wohhhh wow, I did it again, didn't I?</p>

<p>OK... what was I trying to do a minute ago?</p>
